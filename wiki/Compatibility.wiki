==Java version==
Minimum version of JVM required to run Luke is 1.5.

==Lucene Java indexes==
Luke should be able to open indexes built using the following versions of Lucene-Java:

 * 2.x (any version)
 * _(1.9? 1.4? earlier? to be verified)_

Please note that if you used Field.Store.COMPRESSED in your index, your field can be still retrieved by Lucene 2.9+, but the content of the field will be automatically decompressed. This means that during optimize the size of your index may grow substantially.

==Lucene.Net indexes==
Apparently recent versions of Lucene-Java cannot open indexes built with Lucene.Net - reported incompatible versions include:

 * Lucene.Net 2.3.2.1 and Lucene-Java 2.9.1

At the moment there is no workaround for this issue.
